Analytical hierarchy process: structuring of a problem into a hierarchy consisting of a goal and subordinate features of the problem, and pairwise comparisons between elements at each level. Goal programming: Pareto optimality, soft constraints, identifying the efficient frontier, and duality and sensitivity analysis. Data envelopment analysis: relative efficiency measurements, DEA model and analysis, graphical representation, and dual DEA model. Agent based modeling: complex adaptive systems, emergent structures and dynamic behaviors. Discrete event simulation: random number generators and generating random variates. Selecting input probability distributions, and output data analysis. Neural networks: neuron model and network architecture, perceptron learning rule, and Back propagation. Support vector machines: Learning methodology, linear learning machines, kernel-induced feature spaces.
